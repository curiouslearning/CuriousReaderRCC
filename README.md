# Description

The Curious Reader is a storytelling and eBook platform that is designed to encourage enriched interactivity. The platform includes a particular set of interactions that help with the process of learning to read. Curious Reader books are developed to provide interesting and content-rich stories in a familiar context. Curious Reader books support exposure and acquisition of new vocabulary words presented in a content-rich environment. 

The Curious Reader platform emphasizes the connection between animation and text. Stories are written and designed to emphasize the meanings of words as shown in the illustrations or animations. Children are able to experience words in an interactive context. The underlying purpose is to deepen the spoken and written language learning experience.
